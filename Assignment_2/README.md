## About Me

Hi, my name is Deepak Kumar, I am a grad student at Northeastern University, majoring in Information Systems. Over the past three years, I have had the privilege of working at Accenture as a Senior Data Engineer. During this time, I had the opportunity to engage in multiple projects that enhanced my technical skills, particularly in areas such as cloud computing, data engineering, and data warehousing. Additionally, I developed crucial leadership skills, including effective time management, teamwork, timely communication and collaboration within diverse teams. With this comprehensive skill set in hand, I'm eagerly awaiting the right opportunity to further contribute to my field.
